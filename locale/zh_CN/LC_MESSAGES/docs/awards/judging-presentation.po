"At the beginning of a competition, teams will have a 5 minute presentation "
"followed by a brief Q&A period where judges can ask questions about the "
"portfolio and presentation. Following this, judges may sometimes do follow "
"up interviews in the pits where they ask teams more questions about specific"
" things to help in their deliberations. This process is as important as your"
" written documentation when it comes to the success of your team in awards."

"评审环节开始时，参赛队将进行 5 "
"分钟的陈述演示，随后是简短的问答时间，评委可就工笔摘要和陈述演示提问。之后，评委有时会在pit区进行后续采访，就具体问题向参赛队提出更多问题，以帮助他们进行审议。这个过程与参赛队的书面材料一样重要，关系到团队能否成功获奖。"
