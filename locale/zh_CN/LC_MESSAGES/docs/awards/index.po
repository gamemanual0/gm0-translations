"*FIRST*\\ |reg| Tech Challenge is more than just building robots, it "
"contains elements of engineering documentation, outreach, and more. While "
"the majority of |gm0| talks about how to make decisions about creating your "
"robot, the portfolio you write is actually showing how you made those "
"decisions and how you impact the STEM community around you in a positive "
"way."
msgstr ""
"*FIRST*\\ |reg| 科技挑战赛不仅仅是制作机器人，它还包含工程文档、推广等元素。虽然 |gm0| "
"的大部分内容都是关于如何为创建机器人做出决定，但你撰写的作品集实际上是在展示你是如何做出这些决定的，以及你是如何以积极的方式影响周围的 STEM "
"社区的。"

"**It only benefits you to go for awards. You can't win awards without making"
" a portfolio, and in certain states the only way to advance is awards and in"
" others it can make it significantly easier to advance.** In the past an "
"engineering notebook was required for awards, however this is no longer "
"true. Therefore, these are the topics that will be covered in this section "
"of |gm0|."

"**只有获得奖项才对你有好处。如果没有制作工程笔记，就无法获得奖项，而在某些州，唯一的晋升途径就是通过获奖，而在其他州，获奖可以显著地提高晋升的机会。**"
" 过去，获奖需要工程笔记，但现在不再需要。因此，在这 |gm0| 这一部分中将涵盖这些主题。"

"Judging and awards are extremely subjective and some rules change a bit from"
" state to state. What works in one region may not in other regions. So "
"contact your judges about specifics of some things; for example some "
"competitions allow you to turn a custom control award sheet, others only "
"accept the one listed by *FIRST*. The writers of this part of |gm0| have "
"extensive experience with awards and have even been winners and finalists "
"for the Inspire Award at the World Championships."

"评审和评奖极具主观性，有些规则在各州之间会有一些变化。在一个地区适用的规则在其他地区可能不适用。因此，请联系你的评委了解某些事情的具体情况；例如，有些比赛允许你制作自定义控制奖表，而有些比赛则只接受"
" *FIRST* 列出的奖表。 |gm0| 这一部分的作者在评奖方面拥有丰富的经验，他们甚至曾是世界锦标赛 \"激励奖 \"的获奖者和入围者。"

"For most awards, teams have a 5 minute presentation at the beginning of the "
"day followed by some Q&A time and possibly pit judging later on (read the "
"section on the judging process for more detail). There are 7 awards for "
"FTC\\ |reg| teams (excluding awards that cannot advance a team)."

"对于大多数奖项，参赛队都要在比赛开始时进行 5 分钟的陈述，然后是一些问答时间，稍后还可能进行现场评审（请阅读 \"评审流程 "

"Always remember that regardless of how well you feel you did, awards have a "
"level of subjectivity of the judges, so there is no way to 100% control how "
"your team does for awards."

"Overall, awards are one of the core parts of the *FIRST* Tech Challenge "
"competition. They recognize teams at the end of every competition (except "
"league meets) as well as determine many of the teams that advance."
msgstr "总的来说，奖项是 *FIRST* 科技挑战赛的核心部分之一。在每次比赛（联赛除外）结束时，他们都会对参赛队进行表彰，并决定许多晋级队伍。"
