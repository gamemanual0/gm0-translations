"Choosing a :term:`servo <Servo>` can seem daunting at first, given the "
"number of options to consider. This guide is intended to provide a starting "
"point to compare different servo options, and also has some hand picked "
"recommendations at the end."

"It is very important to keep the reliability of a given vendor in mind when "
"choosing servos. It is not uncommon for manufacturers and resellers on "
"Amazon and other similar sites to exaggerate their servos specs, or pick "
"unrealistic best case scenarios for measuring the specs. We have limited our"
" recommendation only to vendors who historically have been reliable with "
"publishing servo specifications."

"在选择伺服电机时，牢记特定供应商的可靠性非常重要。亚马逊和其他类似网站上的制造商和经销商夸大其舵机规格或选择不切实际的最佳情况来衡量规格的做法并不少见。我们的推荐仅限于在发布伺服电机规格方面历来可靠的供应商。"

"As a rule of thumb established manufacturers (HiTech, Savox, ServoCity, "
"Gobilda, Andymark, etc) will usually publish accurate numbers, and servos "
"from marketplaces (Amazon, AliExpress, etc) should be viewed with some "
"skepticism."
msgstr ""
"根据经验，知名制造商（HiTech、Savox、ServoCity、Gobilda、Andymark "
"等）通常会公布准确的数字，而对于来自市场（亚马逊、AliExpress 等）的舵机则应持怀疑态度。"
