"In the past, the Xbox 360 controller was preferred by many top teams over "

"communicate that the stick has shifted slightly. This means that when the "
"joystick is moved to a position where the controller can detect it, the "
"robot will sometimes have a tendency to lurch forward. Dead spots make it "
"difficult for the driver to execute fine-tuned and precise movements. **This"

"过去，与Logitech F310 相比，Xbox 360 控制器是许多顶级团队的首选。这主要是因为 Xbox "
