"Any FTC motor or servo has two properties: speed and torque (or rotational "
"force). These two properties are inversely proportional, meaning that "
"increasing speed decreases torque, and vice versa. For instance, if one "
"wishes to make a mechanism faster at the expense of torque by doubling the "
"speed of that 20:1 gearbox, they would decrease the gear ratio by a factor "
"of 2. Since 20 divided by 2 is 10, the new desired ratio would be 10:1 (this"
" is referred to as gearing up). However, if one wishes to double torque "
"instead, making the system more powerful and robust at the expense of speed,"
" they would increase the gear ratio by a factor of 2, leaving them with a "
"40:1 ratio (this is referred to as gearing down)."

"任何 FTC "
"马达或舵机都有两个特性：速度和扭矩（或旋转力）。这两种特性成反比，即速度增加扭矩减小，反之亦然。例如，如果有人希望通过将20:1变速箱的速度提高一倍来加快机械装置的速度，但却牺牲了扭矩，那么他就会将齿轮比降低2倍。由于20除以2等于0，因此新的理想齿轮比将是10:1（这被称为齿轮升速）。但是，如果希望将扭矩增加一倍，在牺牲速度的情况下使系统更强大、更坚固，则需要将齿轮比增加2倍，使齿轮比为40:1（这被称为降档）。"
