"Have you ever looked inside your robot and thought \"what a mess of wires\"?"
" Wiring is extremely important in FTC\\ |reg|, but is often overlooked or "
"hastily done the hour before competition starts. However, time spent in "
"wiring the robot properly is crucial to the performance and maintenance of "
"the robot."
msgstr ""
"您是否有过这样的经历：看着自己的机器人，心想 \"电线真乱\"？布线在 FTC\\ |reg| "
"中极为重要，但往往被忽视或在比赛开始前一小时匆忙完成。然而，正确布线对机器人的性能和维护至关重要。"

"It is highly discouraged for teams to overlook wiring, but many new teams "
"seem to disregard it or put little thought into wiring the robot properly."

"While tedious and often no fun, wiring can mean the difference between a win"
" and loss. The best robot in the world won't be able to work if a wire is "
"loose or gets tangled up in the middle of a match. Thus it is imperative "
"that wiring is purposefully thought out when designing and building a robot."
msgstr ""
"布线工作虽然繁琐，而且往往毫无乐趣可言，但却能决定胜负。如果在比赛中电线松动或被缠住，再好的机器人也无法工作。因此，在设计和制造机器人时，必须有目的地考虑布线问题。"

"*FIRST*\\ |reg| has created a wiring guide to help teams with tasks like "
"crimping cables, soldering connections, and ESD mitigation that won't be "
"covered in this guide. Once you read up on electronics and wiring here, look"
" at the `FTC Wiring Guide "
"<https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-"
"wiring-guide.pdf>`_ for the best practices and more tips & tricks. In "
"addition, *FIRST* has written an `ESD Mitigation Whitepaper "
"<https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/analysis-"
"esd-mitigation-echin.pdf>`_ that is worth taking a look at."
msgstr ""
"*FIRST*\\ |reg| "
"已创建了一个布线指南，以帮助团队完成本指南未涉及的压接电缆、焊接连接和防静电等任务。当您在这里阅读了电子和布线方面的知识后，请查看 \"FTC 布线指南"
" "
"<https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-"

"<https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/analysis-"

"**Always label wires! When bunched up, you may not know which wire goes into"

"Tie together loose wires, and better yet, tie that bunch of wires to a "
"structural component. This will ensure that wires don't interfere with your "
"mechanisms."
msgstr "将松散的电线绑在一起，最好是将这些电线绑在结构部件上。这将确保电线不会干扰你的装置。"

"**Pay attention to port numbers!** The rev hub will often have multiple "

msgstr "**将每个电线连接都视为可能故障的点**。因此，应使用电工胶带粘贴和绝缘连接，并尽可能使用应力消除装置。"

"**Strain relief** should be used everywhere possible. It is highly "

"**DO NOT solder a wire before crimping it**. Solder can \"creep\" and losing"
