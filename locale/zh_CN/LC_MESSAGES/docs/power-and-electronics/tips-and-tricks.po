"The traditional :term:`XT30` connector that is used to REV is prone to "
"breaking. It is highly recommended that teams replace :term:`XT30` "
"connectors with :term:`Anderson PowerPole`, or put adapters on their current"
" wires. An example of an adapter is `this "
"<https://www.servocity.com/anderson-powerpole-to-female-xt30-adaptor>`_. In "
"lieu of this, teams can also 3D print strain relief connectors on the "
"Expansion Hub to prevent :term:`XT30` disconnects. The file can be found on "
