"**Avoid set screws**. :term:`Set screws <Set Screw>` easily come loose, "
"causing the hub to slip. In addition, :term:`set screws <Set Screw>` damage "
"the :term:`axle <Shaft>`, sometimes making it very hard to remove the hub "
"later. For these reasons, whenever possible, use :term:`clamping hubs "
"<Clamping Hub>` and collars instead of :term:`set screw <Set Screw>` ones. "
"If you must use set screw hubs, use a non-permanent threadlocker such as "
"`Loctite blue <https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-"
"products/specialty/loctite_threadlockerblue242.html>`_ to prevent them from "
"loosening."

"**避免使用固定螺丝**。 :term:`固定螺丝 <Set Screw>` 容易松动，导致 hub 打滑。此外， :term:`固定螺丝 <Set "
"Screw>` 会损坏 :term:`车轴 <Shaft>` ，有时会导致以后很难拆卸 hub 。因此，尽可能使用 :term:`夹 hub  "
"<Clamping Hub>` 和轴环，而不是 :term:`固定螺丝 <Set Screw>` 。如果您必须使用固定螺丝 hub "
"，请使用非永久性螺纹锁固剂，如 `Loctite blue "
"<https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-"
