"**Color code your tools**. If you are using several different sizes of hex "

"different color electric tape for different sizes."

"This situation commonly happens when attaching parts to a :term:`t-slot "
"extrusion <Extrusion>` (Misumi, REV, goBILDA's goRAIL) - if the screw is too"
" long, it will hit the bottom of the slot, and no matter how hard you try, "
"you won't get a tight connection. Another case when this situation arises is"
" when using attachment blocks where two screw holes intersect - if you are "
"not careful, you could have one screw hitting another."
msgstr ""
"这种情况通常发生在将部件连接到 :term:`T型挤压螺丝 <Extrusion>`（Misumi、REV、goBILDA 的 goRAIL）时--"
"如果螺丝太长，就会碰到槽底，无论如何努力都无法实现紧密连接。出现这种情况的另一种情况是在使用两个螺丝孔相交的连接块时--"
"如果不小心，可能会出现一个螺丝撞到另一个螺丝的情况。"

"**Removing stripped screws**. A common problem is removing a screw in which "
"the hex socket head is damaged or worn out and thus the regular hex driver "
"doesn't provide enough holding power to loosen the screw. Here are some ways"
" to deal with the problem."
msgstr ""
"**拆卸剥落的螺丝**。常见的问题是在拆卸螺丝时，六角螺丝刀头已损坏或磨损，因此普通的六角螺丝刀无法提供足够的夹紧力来拧松螺丝。以下是解决这一问题的一些方法。"

"Get a better hex driver. Hex drivers can also be worn out, especially ball "
"head hex drivers. Get a new hex driver (not ball head), which is not yet "
"worn out, and it might give you more traction with stubborn screws."
msgstr ""
"换一个更好的六角螺丝刀。六角起子也会磨损，尤其是球头六角起子。买一个新的六角起子（非球头），它还没有磨损，在拧顽固螺丝时可能会有更大的牵引力。"

"Put a rubber band between the tip of the hex driver and the socket. This "
"increases the traction."
msgstr "在六角起子的顶端和套筒之间套上橡皮筋。这样可以增加牵引力。"
