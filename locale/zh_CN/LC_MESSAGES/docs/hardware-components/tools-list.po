"Here are a selection of necessary and useful tools for your team. You'll "
"obviously need to purchase the basics such as the right screwdriver, hex "
"keys, and drill bits. For a bit more precision and the ability to dabble in "
"custom, opt for a drill press and bandsaw. A router might be useful for "
"teams interested in working with wood, a great material for prototyping (and"
" also for final iterations!)"

"以下是一些团队必备的实用工具。您显然需要购买一些基本工具，如合适的螺丝刀、六角扳手和钻头。如果想获得更高的精度和定制能力，可以选择钻床和带锯。对于有兴趣使用木材的团队来说，刳刨机可能会很有用，因为木材是制作原型的绝佳材料（也是最后迭代的材料！）。"
