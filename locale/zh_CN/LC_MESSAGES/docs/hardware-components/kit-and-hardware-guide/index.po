"Before beginning your season, your team is presented with a crucial decision"
" - one that will undoubtedly heavily influence the team's direction of "
"hardware design in at least the first year. The *FIRST*\\ |reg| storefront "
"currently offers two kits for new teams: the TETRIX kit from Pitsco, and the"
" REV Starter kit from REV Robotics. However, teams should carefully consider"
" other options, such as goBILDA, before selecting a kit."

"在赛季开始前，您的团队将面临一个至关重要的决定--这个决定无疑将在很大程度上影响团队至少第一年的硬件设计方向。*FIRST*\\ |reg| "
"商店目前为新团队提供两种套件：Pitsco 的 TETRIX 套件和 REV Robotics 的 REV "
"入门套件。不过，参赛队在选择套件之前，应仔细考虑其他选项，如 goBILDA。"

"Every build system has advantages and disadvantages, which we have "
"highlighted in our detailed build system guides below. While the guide may "
"not be fully objective, recommendations are based on our own experience with"
" the different kits, so the slant is there with reason. As with pretty much "
"anything in FTC\\ |reg|, there is no one right answer - but there are better"
" answers than others. Hopefully, this guide gives some solid advice on which"
" kit might be the best for your team."

"每种构建系统都有优缺点，我们在下面的详细构建系统指南中重点介绍了这些优缺点。虽然指南可能并不完全客观，但推荐都是基于我们自己使用不同套件的经验，因此会有一些合理的倾向性。与"
" FTC\\ |reg| 中的几乎所有内容一样，没有唯一正确的答案，但有比其他答案更好的答案。希望本指南能就哪种套件最适合你的团队提供一些可靠的建议。"

"After all, plenty of successful robots have not followed this framework. "
"However, we still recommend new teams purchase a starter kit for one big "
"reason. Established teams are all but guaranteed to have spare parts lying "
"around to use to build their next bot. However, rookie teams, as is obvious,"
" don't have the plethora of parts from previous seasons to use. Thus, new "
"teams should purchase these parts themselves in order to have something to "
"build from once the season starts, and starter kits offer these parts for "
"less money than they would be if bought individually. As will be discussed, "
"options that don't involve kits exist and are certainly very useful, but "
"sticking to parts designed for FTC is recommended for new teams as a "
"starting point."
msgstr ""
"毕竟，很多成功的机器人都没有遵循这个框架。不过，我们仍然建议新团队购买入门套件，这其中有一个重要原因。成熟的团队几乎都能保证有备用零件，可以用来制作下一个机器人。然而，新手队伍显然没有前几个赛季的大量零件可用。因此，新队伍应该自己购买这些零件，以便在赛季开始后有零件可用，而入门套件提供的这些零件比单独购买要便宜。正如将要讨论的那样，不涉及套件的选择也是存在的，而且肯定非常有用，但建议新团队以坚持使用为"
" FTC 设计的部件为起点。"

"Choice of a kit is a matter of many a debate in FTC forums, and each team "
"has their favorites. If you are a rookie team and do not have any experience"
" with any of the kits above, we would recommend starting with a kit from "
"either REV Robotics or goBILDA. These kits provide a good selection of "
"parts, reliability, and value for money. They are easily expandable and "
"great part flexibility allows for customization. Keep in mind that "
"compatibility between kits varies and will be impacted by the unit system "
"used."
msgstr ""
"在 FTC 论坛上，套件的选择是一个争论不休的问题，每个团队都有自己的最爱。如果您是新手团队，没有使用过上述任何套件的经验，我们建议您从 REV "
"Robotics 或 goBILDA "
"的套件开始。这些套件提供了丰富的零件选择、可靠性和性价比。它们易于扩展，零件灵活性高，可以进行定制。请记住，套件之间的兼容性各不相同，而且会受到所使用的单元系统的影响。"

"goBILDA (metric) is slightly more expensive, but is easier to get started "
"with. It has an extensive parts catalog and can be adapted to other build "
"systems like REV. However, its price point may deter some teams with lesser "
"budgets."

"goBILDA（公制）稍贵，但更容易上手。它拥有丰富的零件目录，并可与 REV 等其他构建系统相匹配。不过，它的价位可能会让一些预算较少的团队望而却步。"

"REV Robotics (metric) is slightly cheaper but generally has a bit higher "
"learning curve than most other kits, as it is :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` "
"rather than :term:`channel <Channel>` based. :term:`Extrusion` takes more "
"effort to work with (you need to cut aluminum extrusion to length); however,"
" it allows for maximum design freedom and adjustability. REV is also "
"available from the *FIRST* storefront, which might be convenient for teams "
"doing their purchasing through official school procurement systems."
msgstr ""
"REV Robotics（公制）略微便宜一些，但学习曲线一般比其他大多数套件要高一些，因为它是基于 :term:`铝型材 <Extrusion>` "
"而不是 :term:`通道梁 <Channel>` 的。:term:`铝型材` "
"需要更多的精力来操作（你需要将铝型材切割成一定的长度）；但是，它允许最大的设计自由度和可调整性。REV也可从 *FIRST* "
"商店购买，这对于通过学校官方采购系统进行采购的团队来说可能比较方便。"

"Tetrix (metric and imperial) is probably the simplest system to work with, "
