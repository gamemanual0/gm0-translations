"Channel is fixed pitch, which means that there are pre-drilled holes that "
"limit mounting to finite locations. It can be used to easily construct "
"drivetrains; however, be aware that :term:`gear <Gear>` and :term:`chain "
"<Chain>` mesh may not be with channel."
msgstr ""
"槽钢是固定间距的，这意味着预先钻好的孔将安装位置限制在有限范围内。它可用于轻松构建传动系统；但要注意，:term:`gear <Gear>` 和 "
":term:`chain <Chain>` 网格可能与槽钢不匹配。"
