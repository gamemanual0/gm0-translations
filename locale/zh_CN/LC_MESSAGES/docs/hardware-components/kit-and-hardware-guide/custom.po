"Many teams elect to ignore kits entirely and instead make their own "
"mechanisms completely from scratch. While this allows for nearly unlimited "
"design freedom, keep in mind *full* Custom has many caveats and drawbacks. A"
" full CAD model is required for a custom robot, as well as machining "
"capability. Custom robots are not suitable for a new team."
msgstr ""
"许多团队选择完全忽略套件，而是完全从头开始制造自己的机制。虽然这允许几乎无限的设计自由，但请记住完全定制有许多警告和缺点。定制机器人需要完整的计算机辅助设计模型以及加工能力。定制机器人不适合新团队。"

"However, forgoing a full custom robot opens up many opportunities. Many "
"teams choose to create a robot that is a mix of kit parts and custom parts. "
"Our recommendation is to use kit parts as the backbone of the robot, and "
"custom fabricate any additional parts necessary, instead of the other way "
"around. That way, you can rely on the strength and durability of the kit "
"while retaining the ability to customize small pieces and mechanisms to your"
" advantage."

"然而，放弃完全定制的机器人会带来很多机会。许多团队选择创建一个由套件部件和定制部件混合而成的机器人。我们的建议是使用套件部件作为机器人的骨干，并定制制造任何必要的附加部件，而不是相反。这样，您可以依靠套件的强度和耐用性，同时保留定制小件和机制的能力。"

"The methods that teams use to make custom parts typically involve either "
"additive or subtractive manufacturing: either building a part from raw "
"material (3d printing) or removing material from stock to create a part "
"(Milling, Routing, and Laser Cutting)."
msgstr "团队用于制造定制零件的方法通常涉及加法制造或减法制造：从原材料搭建零件（3d打印）或从库存中移除材料以创建零件（铣削、布线和激光切割）。"
