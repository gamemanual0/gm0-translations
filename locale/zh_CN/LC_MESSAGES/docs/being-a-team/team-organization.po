"The first step to organizing a team is determining who does what. Generally,"
" FTC\\ |reg| teams are organized into design, assembly / mechanical, "
"software, and outreach squads, with different sub-squads for different tasks"
" - for example, an outreach squad could have a sub-squad working on industry"
" connections. In addition, your team will probably form cross-squad teams, "
"such as your drive team and scouting team."

"组织一个团队的第一步是确定谁负责什么。一般来说，FTC\\ |reg| "
"团队分为设计、装配/机械、软件和外联四个小组，每个小组根据不同的任务再分为不同的子小组——例如，外联小组可以有一个负责与行业联系的子小组。此外，你的团队可能还会形成跨小组的团队，比如操作团队和侦察团队。"

"为了有效地管理这些小组，你需要设定一个精心选择的领导结构——领导者应该具备良好的委派能力，并愿意为他们所负责的小组成员提供学习经验。你也可以选择一个队长来监督各个小组的领导者。"

"Each individual member should decide which squad they would like to "

"upcoming season - and regardless, the mechanical techniques you learn will "
"be helpful. Reaching out to STEM businesses before the season will help you "

"暑期项目是探索机器人概念和开始外联的好方法。例如，你的团队可以研究不同的举升设计，并创建一个优缺点的决策矩阵。很多时候，你研究的设计会出现在你下个赛季的竞赛机器人上——而且无论如何，你学到的机械技巧都会有帮助。在赛季开始前与STEM企业联系，将帮助你获得对未来一年有用的见解，而且在你的社区中规划和实施外联活动，将让你在赛季开始时领先一步。"

"This is the most important knowledge-related pointer, in my opinion. Having "
"all your members learn at least one skill outside of their expertise will go"
" a long way towards increasing collaboration and efficiency. Programmers who"
" CAD will be able to design and integrate their own sensor cases, reducing "

"在我看来，这是最重要的与知识相关的指导。让你所有的成员至少学习一项超出他们专长范围的技能，将大大提高团队的协作和效率。会CAD的程序员将能够设计和集成他们自己的传感器外壳，减少设计团队的工作量。懂得外联的设计师将能够更有效地撰写他们的部分并在评委面试中展示他们的设计。了解他们机器人上的机械和软件流程的外联人员更有效率。"
