"Hello! Welcome and thank you for taking the time to read |gm0|, the premier "
"resource for new and upcoming *FIRST*\\ |reg| Tech Challenge teams! If you "
"are a rookie or a new team, we would especially like to welcome you to the "
"FTC\\ |reg| community. We want to make your beginning steps and transition "
"into FTC as seamless as possible, and offer some of our own experience and "
"advice compiled over the years."

"你好！欢迎并感谢你抽出时间阅读 |gm0| ，这是 *FIRST*\\ |reg| "
"科技挑战赛新团队和即将加入团队的主要资源！如果你是新手或新团队，我们特别欢迎你加入 FTC\\ |reg| 社区。我们希望让你尽可能顺利地开始和过渡到 "
"FTC，并提供我们多年来积累的一些经验和建议。"

"The goal of |gm0| is to create a comprehensive guide for FTC teams. Physical"
" resources for FTC are few and far between, and online resources are "
"scattered across the interwebs. Typically, the largest inhibitor for newer "
"teams is the lack of knowledge base, as robotics is a relatively new STEM "
"field. New teams also have not made connections to experienced teams who "
"might mentor or offer advice throughout the season. Thus, they are left in "
"the dark to figure things out, seemingly with no way out. While the journey "
"of learning cannot be shortcut, |gm0| seeks to address these shortcomings by"
" providing a starter's guide to the hardware and software in *FIRST* Tech "
"Challenge."
msgstr ""
"|gm0| 的目标是为 FTC 团队创建一个全面的指南。针对 FTC "
"的实体资源少之又少，而在线资源则分散在互联网上。通常情况下，新团队最大的障碍是缺乏知识基础，因为机器人技术是一个相对较新的 STEM "
"领域。新团队也没有与经验丰富的团队建立联系，这些团队可能会在整个赛季中提供指导或建议。因此，他们只能在黑暗中摸索，似乎没有出路。虽然学习的过程没有捷径可走，"
" |gm0| 试图通过提供 *FIRST* 科技挑战赛的硬件和软件入门指南来弥补这些不足。"

"When perusing this guide, it is important to keep in mind the authors' "
"perspective. Many of the teams who contributed in the writing of this guide "
"are veteran championship level teams in the upper echelon of FTC. **This "
"means that most of our recommendations are almost solely from the "
"competitive advantage standpoint.** For example, teams can learn just as "
"much from using a Tetrix kit compared to a goBILDA kit. Just because there "
"is a competitive advantage to one does not translate into a learning "
"disadvantage for the other. The guide has a plethora of useful information "
"and knowledge (such as FTC and basic engineering principles) for all teams, "
"including teams which are primarily trying to learn rather than compete. "
"However, do take our recommendations with a grain of salt. We want to help "
"all teams in FTC, but as our experience has been on the competitive side of "
"the fence, certain parts of the guide may not be very applicable to some "
"teams."
msgstr ""
"在阅读本指南时，必须牢记作者的观点。参与编写本指南的许多团队都是 FTC 高级别的资深冠军级团队。 "
"**这意味着我们的大多数建议几乎都是从竞争优势的角度出发的。** 例如，与 goBILDA 套件相比，参赛队从使用 Tetrix "
"套件中学到的东西同样多。不能因为其中一种工具具有竞争优势，就认为另一种工具在学习上处于劣势。指南中包含了大量有用的信息和知识（如 FTC "
"和基本工程原理），适用于所有团队，包括以学习而非竞争为主要目的的团队。但是，请谨慎对待我们的建议。我们希望在 FTC "
"中帮助所有团队，但由于我们的经验是在竞争方面，指南的某些部分可能对某些团队不太适用。"

"Furthermore, the guide was originally written with a specific audience in "
"mind - young teams who have recently begun their journey in FTC. Our "
"recommendations are generally geared towards more inexperienced teams. "
"However, in the past couple years we have expanded the guide to provide more"
" in-depth resources around more complex topics. In doing so, we hope that "
"|gm0| will be a useful resource to rookie and veteran teams alike."
msgstr ""
"此外，本指南最初是针对特定受众编写的，即刚刚开始 FTC "
"之旅的年轻团队。我们的建议一般都是针对缺乏经验的团队。不过，在过去几年中，我们扩展了指南的内容，围绕更复杂的主题提供了更深入的资源。我们希望 |gm0|"
" 能成为新手和老手团队的有用资源。"

"Before diving in, a short disclaimer: **this guide is not \"How to Build a "
"Championship-Winning Robot.\"** The purpose of |gm0| is simply to provide "
"knowledge, advice, and tips on how to get started."

"在正式开始之前，有一个简短的免责声明：**本指南并不是 “如何制造夺冠机器人”** ， |gm0| 的目的只是提供有关如何开始的知识、建议和技巧。"

"It is of the utmost importance that all teams learn the proper way (by "
"following the engineering design process), not by reading a step-by-step "
"guide or instruction manual. Thus, while |gm0| has plenty of advice, we do "
"not have specific steps included. Good luck, and have fun in FTC!"
msgstr ""
"最重要的是，所有团队都要以正确的方式（按照工程设计流程）学习，而不是通过阅读分步指南或使用手册。因此，虽然 |gm0| "
"有很多建议，但我们并不包含具体步骤。祝你好运，在 FTC 中玩得开心！"
