"The first consideration when designing 3D printed parts is print "
"orientation. This refers to the side that contacts the print bed. "
"Preferably, the part should have a flat bottom to maximize contact with the "
"print bed."
msgstr "设计3D打印部件时首先考虑的是打印方向，这是指与打印床接触的一侧，优选地，该部件应具有平底，以最大限度地与打印床接触。"

"Maximizing contact with the print bed will make sure the part doesn't "
"delaminate or warp from the bed and increase print quality."

"If it is impossible for the part to have a flat side to print on, a simple "
"solution is to split the part into multiple parts along a plane. For "
"instance, the gearbox plate below didn't have a flat side to print on, so it"
" was split in half. The part was later sandwiched with numerous screws and "
"plastic glue. If this plate was printed as one part instead of split in "
"half, support would have to be used to create all of the necessary holes. "
"Parts that use no support material make sure that the least amount of "
"plastic is wasted."

"如果零件不可能有平坦的一面可以打印，一个简单的解决方案是沿着平面将零件分成多个部分。例如，下面的变速箱板没有平坦的一面可以打印，所以它被分成两半。这个零件后来被夹在许多螺丝和塑料胶水中。如果这个板是作为一个零件打印的，而不是分成两半，就必须使用支架来制造所有必要的孔。不使用支撑材料的零件可以确保浪费最少的塑料。"

"Draft angle refers to the overhang angle between the part side and normal "
"vector from the print plate. The maximum draft angle refers to the maximum "
"angle the printer can print without support material and is based on the "
"printer, print settings (notably speed, temperature and cooling) and "
"filament type. When trying to decrease support material, consider every "
"overhang angle and make sure it is within the maximum draft angle. Staying "
"within the maximum draft angle will also decrease the chances of part "
"warping."
msgstr ""
"拔模角是指部件侧面与打印板法向量之间的悬垂角度。最大拔模角是指打印机在不使用支撑材料的情况下可以打印的最大角度，取决于打印机、打印设置（主要是速度、温度和冷却）以及长丝类型。在尝试减少支撑材料时，要考虑每个悬伸角度，并确保其在最大牵伸角度范围内。保持在最大拔模角范围内也会降低部件翘曲的几率。"

"Perhaps the most important consideration is stress vectors. 3D printed parts"
" are inherently stronger on two axes and weaker on one axis. The weaker axis"
" comes from the layering action that defines FDM 3D printing. A common fix "
"to this is to simply increase the print temperature up to a certain limit "
"until it starts decreasing print quality, but the weaker axis can be "
"resolved by again splitting up into multiple parts. The point to get across "
"is to try to increase strength by optimizing sections of the part on the "
"plane they are being printed on. For instance, this assembly below was "
"responsible for hanging the entire robot, so it had to be the maximum "
"strength possible for a 3D printed part."
msgstr ""
"也许最重要的考虑因素是应力矢量。3D打印零件在两个轴上天生更强，在一个轴上更弱。较弱的轴来自定义FDM3D打印的分层动作。一个常见的解决方法是简单地将打印温度提高到一定的限度，直到它开始降低打印质量，但是较弱的轴可以通过再次分成多个部分来解决。要理解的一点是尝试通过优化零件在打印平面上的部分来提高强度。例如，下面的组件负责悬挂整个机器人，因此它必须是3D打印零件的最大强度。"

"It might seem counterintuitive to split up a part into multiple parts to "

"The part could have been easily printed as a single part, but it would be "
"fairly weak when stresses are exerted in the upward direction. Splitting the"
" part and creating new flat surfaces to print on will strengthen each axis. "
"*If one small part failed, the robot might still be able to somewhat "
"function.* This would be preferable to the entire piece failing at once. In "
"this example, the side pieces were printed as separate parts on a "
"complementary axis to strengthen the assembly."
msgstr ""
"该零件可以很容易地作为单个零件打印，但当向上施加应力时，它会相当弱。拆分零件并创建新的平坦表面来打印将加强每个轴。如果一个小零件发生故障，机器人可能仍然能够发挥一定的作用。这比整个零件一次发生故障要好。在这个例子中，侧件作为单独的零件打印在互补轴上，以加强组件。"
