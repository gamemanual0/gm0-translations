"Perhaps the biggest barrier when making a fully custom robot is that it "
"requires very expensive manufacturing equipment. While 3D printers have "
"become more and more common in FTC\\ |reg| and allow teams to create or "
"customize small parts, many teams do not have access to equipment such as "
"lathes, routers, waterjet cutters, or CNC machines."
msgstr ""
"制作全定制机器人的最大障碍可能是需要非常昂贵的制造设备。虽然 3D 打印机在 FTC\\ |reg| "
"中越来越常见，并允许团队创建或定制小部件，但许多团队无法使用车床、刳刨机、水刀切割机或数控机床等设备。"

"Another barrier is that prototyping with fully custom systems is almost "
"always much slower than using kit parts. The full CAD process takes time, "
"and fabrication/getting parts fabricated by a shop or sponsor is another "
"lengthy process. Notwithstanding those two factors, if something goes "
"drastically wrong then it will require a repeat process of CAD and "
"fabrication."
msgstr ""
"另一个障碍是，完全定制系统的原型制作几乎总是比使用配套零件要慢得多。完整的 CAD "
"流程需要时间，而制造/让商店或赞助商制造部件又是一个漫长的过程。尽管有这两个因素，但如果出了大问题，就需要重复 CAD 和制造过程。"

"It must be noted that teams do not need to pick between a fully kit-based "
"robot or a fully custom robot. In fact, many successful teams are actually a"
" hybrid of both kit and custom parts, as can be seen in many of example "
"robots in this section."
msgstr ""
"必须指出的是，参赛队不必在完全基于套件的机器人和完全定制的机器人之间做出选择。事实上，许多成功的团队实际上是套件和定制部件的混合体，本节中的许多机器人示例就体现了这一点。"

"However, our suggestion is that inexperienced teams should prioritize 3D "
