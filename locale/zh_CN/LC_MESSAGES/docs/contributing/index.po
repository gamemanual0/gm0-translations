"**These goals do not necessarily build upon each other.** For example, let's"
" look at the :doc:`/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/index` section. If we"
" want to simply guide more rookie teams on a path to become successful, we "
"would discuss the very popular drivetrains that teams may encounter (2WD, "
"4WD, 6WD, mecanum, X-Drive, and H-Drive) so that teams can quickly get up to"
" speed and choose a competitive drivetrain. However, if the goal is to be a "
"comprehensive reference, we would include every single possible drivetrain "
"ever created for FTC, even if they aren't very competitive or realistic for "
"newer teams to build (swerve, ball, octocanum, etc)."
msgstr ""
"**这些目标并不一定相互依存。** 例如，让我们看看 :doc:`/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/index` "
"部分。如果我们只是想引导更多菜鸟车队走向成功，我们就会讨论车队可能会遇到的非常流行的动力传动系统（2WD、4WD、6WD、mecanum、X-Drive"
" 和 H-Drive），这样车队就可以快速上手并选择有竞争力的动力传动系统。但是，如果我们的目标是成为一个全面的参考资料，那么我们就会包括所有可能的 "
"FTC 传动系统，即使这些传动系统对于新车队来说不是很有竞争力或不现实（swerve、ball、octocanum 等）。"

"We are seeking to accomplish both goals with a new structure: there will be "

"我们希望通过一种新的结构来实现这两个目标：将会有一个“面向新手”页面，它将链接到一个专为新手设计的页面列表，而这个列表之外的页面可以作为更全面的参考。"

"**Game Manual 0 is a guide from primarily a competitive standpoint.** In "

"**Game Manual 0 seeks to inform, not tell.** |gm0| does not wish to "
"encourage one \"meta\" design or series of techniques, instead, the guide "

"of each, and let teams make their own decisions for their own circumstances."
" If recommendations are given, they must be based on objective, repeatable "
"reasoning. For more information on this, read the :doc:`style-guide`."
msgstr ""
"**Game Manual 0 旨在提供信息，而不是告诉别人。** Game Manual 0 "
"并不希望鼓励一种“元”设计或一系列技术，相反，本指南旨在为团队提供多种选择，并列出每种选择的利弊，让团队根据自身情况做出决定。如果要提出建议，则必须基于客观、可重复的推理。有关这方面的更多信息，请阅读"

"**Game Manual 0 is generally a high level concept guide.** This means that "
"information is given in a way that is applicable to many situations, rather "
"than a series of steps. However, when possible we link to external "
"documentation to plug any knowledge gaps. For example: in the electronics "
"sections, we do not discuss how to exactly wire the robot using the REV "
"control system, instead we link to the REV documentation for exact wiring "
"and discuss general wiring best practices."
msgstr ""
"**Game Manual 0 通常是一个高水平的概念指南。** "
"这意味着所提供的信息适用于多种情况，而不是一系列步骤。不过，在可能的情况下，我们会链接到外部文档，以填补知识空白。例如：在电子部分，我们不讨论如何使用 "
"REV 控制系统为机器人精确布线，而是链接到 REV 文档以了解精确布线，并讨论一般布线最佳实践。"
