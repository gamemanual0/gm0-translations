"When using any method in the FTC\\ |reg| SDK that accesses hardware, be that"
" setting motor power, reading an encoder, a sensor, etc., a LynxCommand is "
"sent."
msgstr "当使用 FTC |reg| SDK 中的任何方法访问硬件时，比如设置电机功率、读取编码器、传感器等，都会发送LynxCommand。"

"LynxCommands are not sent directly from the Robot Controller to an Expansion"
" Hub through USB; in an expansion hub they are sent through USB to an FTDI, "
"which converts the USB signal to a UART one. In the control hub, this USB "
"step is skipped, instead the control hub board sends the data directly over "
"UART to the internal expansion hub."
msgstr ""
"LynxCommand不是通过USB直接从机器人控制器发送到Expansion "
"Hub；在扩展集线器中，它们通过USB发送到FTDI，FTDI将USB信号转换为通用异步收发设备信号（UART）。在Control "
"Hub中，跳过此USB步骤，而是Control Hub主板直接通过UART将数据发送到内部Expansion Hub。"

"LynxCommands being blocking (and more specifically a master lock being "
"present on each usb device) means that multithreading hardware calls is at "
"best not helpful and typically harmful to performance."
msgstr "LynxCommand被阻塞（更具体地说，每个USB设备上都有一个主锁）意味着多线程硬件调用充其量是没有帮助的，通常对性能有害。"

"If an Android phone and Expansion Hub is used, LynxCommands are sent over "
"USB; however if a Control Hub is used, LynxCommands are sent over UART. This"
" is very important, not just because of the increased reliability with UART "
"instead of USB, but also because LynxCommands take approximately 3 "
"milliseconds over USB and approximately 2 milliseconds over UART."
msgstr ""
"如果使用Android手机和扩展集线器，LynxCommand将通过USB发送；但是，如果使用Control "
"Hub，LynxCommand将通过通用异步收发设备发送。这一点非常重要，不仅因为通用异步收发设备而不是USB提高了可靠性，而且因为LynxCommand在USB上大约需要3毫秒，在通用异步收发设备上大约需要2毫秒。"

"Any expansion hubs connected via RS485 receive their commands via that "
"connector. Lynx hubs do not have to retransmit packets, so the added latency"
" from this process isn't significant, but there will be some added latency. "
"Up to 255 expansion hubs can be connected together in theory."
msgstr ""
"任何通过RS485连接的扩展集线器都通过该连接器接收它们的命令。Lynx集线器不必重传数据包，因此此过程增加的延迟并不显著，但会增加一些延迟。理论上最多可以将255个扩展集线器连接在一起。"

"Interacting with I2C devices takes significantly longer; upwards of 7 "
"milliseconds over USB. However, this is not because each LynxCommand takes "
"longer, but because multiple LynxCommands must be sent to interact with I2C."
msgstr ""
"与I2C设备交互需要更长的时间；通过USB超过7毫秒。但是，这并不是因为每个LynxCommand需要更长的时间，而是因为必须发送多个LynxCommand才能与I2C交互。"

"Please note that since version 5.5 of the SDK, I2C calls on the Control Hub "
"are much faster than those on the Expansion Hub. This is because the polling"
" rate was dramatically increased, which can cut down on unnecessary wasted "
"time."
msgstr ""
"请注意，从SDK5.5版本开始，Control Hub上的I2C调用比Expansion "
"Hub上的调用快得多。这是因为轮询率大幅提高，这可以减少不必要的浪费时间。"
