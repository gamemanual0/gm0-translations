"Servos are controlled via a PWM signal. PWM signal is one where the signal "
"turns on for a number of microseconds, then off for a number of "
"microseconds. Servos are controlled by sending variable length pulses every "
"20 ms, with the length of the pulses dictating what angle the servo should "
"move to (or with CR servos, what speed it should move at). This length of "
"the pulse, expressed in microseconds, is called the PWM pulse width. By "
"default, the sdk generates signals from 600 to 2400 microseconds (with SDK 0"
" being 600 microseconds, and SDK 1 being 2400 microseconds). However, the "
"expansion hub can actually generate between 500 and 2500 microseconds if the"
" range is set manually."

"舵机通过PWM信号进行控制。PWM信号是信号开启若干微秒，然后关闭若干微秒的信号。舵机通过每20毫秒发送可变长度的脉冲来控制，脉冲的长度决定舵机应该移动到什么角度（或者CR舵机，它应该以什么速度移动）。脉冲的长度，以微秒表示，称为PWM脉冲宽度。默认情况下，sdk生成600到2400微秒的信号（SDK0是600微秒，SDK1是2400微秒）。然而，如果手动设置范围，扩展集线器实际上可以生成500到2500微秒之间的信号。"

"All servos require a minimum of 5V to operate, and so the expansion hub "
"generates 5V to power the servos. The 5V power is shared between pairs of "
"ports (0-1, 2-3, 4-5). By default, this 5V power is OFF, and doesn't provide"
" power. However, doing any servo operation, such as setting the position of "
"a servo, will turn ON the 5V power to both shared ports. Calling disable PWM"
" seems to turn OFF shared power, however if another servo is used or is "
"active the 5V power will remain ON instead."

"所有舵机系统都需要至少5V才能运行，因此扩展集线器产生5V来为舵机系统供电。5V电源在成对端口（0-1、2-3、4-5）之间共享。默认情况下，此5V电源关闭，不提供电源。但是，执行任何舵机操作，例如设置舵机的位置，将打开两个共享端口的5V电源。调用禁用PWM似乎关闭了共享电源，但是如果使用另一个舵机或激活，5V电源将保持打开状态。"
