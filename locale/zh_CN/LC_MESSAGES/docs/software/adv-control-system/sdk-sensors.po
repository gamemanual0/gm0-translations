"I2C is a two wire serial communication bus that is designed to communicate "
"with multiple devices. The two wires are the SCL, or clock line, and SDA, or"
" data line. The REV hub connector also contains two more pins for 3.3v and "
"GND. The protocol can address multiple devices using addresses, where the "
"master device sends the address it is communicating with, then the data it "
"wants to send. The device it is talking to then responds. This means any "
"number of devices can be connected to one I2C port, so long as no two "
"devices have the same I2C addresses."

"I2C 是一种双线串行通信总线，设计用于与多个设备通信。这两根线分别是 SCL（时钟线）和 SDA（数据线）。REV "
"集线器连接器上还有两个针脚，分别用于连接 3.3V 和 "
"GND。该协议可使用地址寻址多个设备，主设备发送与之通信的地址，然后发送要发送的数据。与之通话的设备随后做出响应。这意味着一个 I2C "
"端口可以连接任意数量的设备，只要没有两个设备的 I2C 地址相同即可。"

"I2C has multiple speed specifications, but the REV hub supports both 100khz "
"and 400khz communication standards. The specification also requires the "
"lines to be pulled up, so the REV hub has dual 2.49 k\\ |Omega| pull up "
"resistors, negating the need for external pull up resistors."

"I2C is often called slower than other forms of sensors. It is not inherently"
" slower, but due to the way I2C communication works in the SDK it takes "
"multiple commands to read one I2C sensor, which means one I2C read can take "
"2-3x longer than one digital or analog read."
msgstr ""
"I2C 通常被称为比其他形式的传感器慢。它本身并不慢，但由于 SDK 中 I2C 通信的工作方式，读取一个 I2C 传感器需要多条命令，这意味着 I2C"

"Floating occurs when you attempt to read from a digital input pin but the "
"signal is disconnected or not pulled HIGH or to ground. As a result, the pin"
" is considered \"floating\" and can have inconsistent results. To prevent "
"this, a resistor bridges between the port and 3.3V, so that instead of "
"floating the pin instead reads HIGH when nothing is connected."
msgstr ""
"当试图从数字输入引脚读取信号，但信号断开或没有拉高或接地时，就会出现浮动。因此，该引脚被认为是 \"浮动\" "
"的，结果可能不一致。为了避免这种情况，需要在端口和 3.3V 之间桥接一个电阻，这样当没有任何连接时，引脚就不会浮动，而是读取高电平。"

"When wiring limit switches or other digital devices, DO NOT connect the "
