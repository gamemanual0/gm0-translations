"As an example, let's look at an imaginary team building a drivetrain for "
"Rover Ruckus (RR2), which was 2018-2019's game. In RR2, there was a crater, "
"which was about 3\" tall, and could be traversed. In that year's game, there"
" were two main options: traverse said crater, or not traverse it and instead"
" reach over with an arm."

"Ruckus（RR2）建造动力传动系统，这是2018-2019年的游戏。在RR2中，有一个坑，大约3英寸高，可以穿过。在那一年的游戏中，有两个主要选择：穿过这个坑，或者不穿过它，而是用机械臂伸过去。"

"The team must first specify requirements for the drivetrain. One of the most"
" important aspects of a drivetrain is maneuverability. Another requirement "
"could be speed, traction, reliability, etc. From the team's specified "
"requirements, they would now look at drivetrains that fit their "
"requirements. If the team wanted to traverse the crater, then a 4WD or 6WD "
"would be an optimal design. If they did not need to traverse the crater, "
"many options are still on the table such as the holonomic drivetrains."
msgstr ""
"团队必须首先指定动力传动系统的要求。动力传动系统最重要的方面之一是机动性。另一个要求可能是速度、牵引力、可靠性等。从团队指定的要求来看，他们现在将考虑符合他们要求的动力传动系统。如果团队想要穿过坑，那么4WD或6WD将是最佳设计。如果他们不需要穿过坑，许多选项仍然可供选择，例如完整的动力传动系统。"

"From there, a team could begin the prototyping and testing process. This "
"could involve tests of the time taken to cross the crater, time from crater "
"to lander, top speed, maneuverability, etc. Simple tests may be conducted "
"instead of complicated ones. For example, if the robot is projected to weigh"
" 30 pounds, a dumbbell placed on top of the drivetrain simulates the extra "
"weight well to see if the drivetrain can get over the crater easily and "
"reliably, so the robot will not get stuck on the crater edge."
msgstr ""
"自此，一个团队可以开始原型设计和测试的过程。这可能包括测试穿过坑所需的时间、从坑到着陆器的时间、最高速度、可操作性等。可以进行简单的测试，而不是复杂的测试。例如，如果机器人预计重30磅，放置在动力传动系统顶部的哑铃可以模拟额外的重量，看看动力传动系统是否可以轻松可靠地越过坑，这样机器人就不会卡在坑边缘。"

"Next, analyze results and iterate. If, for example, there was too little "
"clearance, and the drivetrain got stuck on the crater part of the time, then"
" it would be necessary to raise the drivebase in order to remediate this "
"problem. However, don't change too many things at once - **you want to "
"change ONLY ONE variable at a time**, or else you won't know what may cause "
"a further problem should it arise. Always try to change one variable at a "
"time."
msgstr ""
"接下来，分析结果并迭代。例如，如果间隙太小，动力传动系统在部分时间卡在坑上，那么就有必要提高动力基础来修复这个问题。然而，不要一次改变太多的东西——你一次只想改变一个变量，否则，你将不知道什么可能导致进一步的问题出现。总是坚持一次改变一个变量。"

"**It often takes multiple iterations to get things right, so don't be "

"you think it will**. Many teams have 10+ iterations of intake designs in "
"order to refine and hone down their design to be optimally efficient. While "
"that many tries isn't recommended for new teams, don't be afraid to modify "
"*one factor* at a time to isolate and solve problems."

"通常需要多次迭代才能把事情做好，所以如果你的第二次甚至第三次尝试没有你想象的那么好，不要气馁。许多团队有10多次迭代的进气设计，以便改进和磨练他们的设计，使其达到最佳效率。虽然不建议新团队尝试这么多次，但不要害怕一次修改一个因素来隔离和解决问题。"
