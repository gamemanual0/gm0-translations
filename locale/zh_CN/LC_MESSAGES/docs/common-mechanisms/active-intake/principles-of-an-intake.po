"An intake must be reliable, as picking up and scoring game elements is the "

"Intakes have many moving parts and are susceptible to breaking, especially "
"at high RPM. Thus, the intake material must be durable to withstand long "
"periods of operation."
msgstr "拾取装置有许多活动部件，很容易损坏，尤其是在高转速时。因此，拾取装置材料必须经久耐用，能够承受长时间运行。"

"Intakes often stick outside of the robot frame perimeter. In this case, "
"durability becomes extremely important; the intake must be built so that "
"they can withstand impacts/collisions with other robots or parts of the "
"field."
msgstr "拾取装置通常位于机器人框架外围。在这种情况下，耐用性就变得极为重要；拾取装置的构造必须能够承受与其他机器人或场地部分的撞击/碰撞。"

"There are two ways to accomplish this - either by building the intake very "
"robustly (lots of support so it doesn't break), or making the intake "
"flexible (for example out of lexan or spring loading it) so that even though"
" it may bend due to impacts, it will always spring back into place."
msgstr ""
"要做到这一点，有两种方法——一种把拾取装置做得非常坚固（有很多支撑，这样就不会断裂)，另一种把拾取装置做得有弹性（例如用lexan或弹簧加载），这样即使拾取装置可能会因撞击而弯曲，它也总能弹回原位。"

"Another way to prevent intake breaking is to make a fully retractable intake"
" that won't protrude outside the 18\" cube, though this is seldom needed."
msgstr "防止拾取装置破损的另一种方法是制作一个完全可伸缩的拾取装置，使其不会伸出 18 英寸立方体之外，不过这种方法很少用到。"

"The intake **must** be able to pick up game elements consistently and "
"quickly. For example, in Rover Ruckus each robot could only possess 2 "
"minerals at a time. Therefore, the intake should only pick up two pieces at "
"a time, not zero, one, or three."
msgstr ""
"拾取装置“必须”能够持续、快速地拾取得分道具。例如，在 Rover Ruckus 中，每个机器人一次只能拥有 2 "
"块道具。因此，拾取装置一次只能拾取两块，而不是零块、一块或三块。"

"Another component is the varying angles that the game objects can be located"
" in. This was especially apparent in the Relic Recovery season, where the "
"\"glyphs\" (foam cubes) could be oriented in many directions."
msgstr "另一个要素是游戏对象可以从不同角度定位。这一点在“文物寻回”赛季中尤为明显，“符文”（泡沫方块）可以朝向多个方向。"

"Even though it was relatively easy to make a compliant wheel intake that "
"could effectively intake glyphs in one direction, it was hard to make an "
"intake that could deal with angled glyphs. Being able to intake glyphs in "
"all orientations was especially important for multi-glyph autonomous modes."

"尽管制作一个能有效摄取单向字形的顺滑轮拾取装置相对容易，但要制作一个能处理倾斜符文的拾取装置却很难。对于多符文自主模式来说，能够拾取所有方向的符文尤为重要。"

"The intake must be able to consistently control the game elements. For "
"example, if the intake is too fast and the collection box is not well "
"designed, then game pieces might fly out. If the intake is too slow, it may "
"jam itself when contacting the game elements."
msgstr ""
"拾取装置必须能够始终如一地控制得分道具。例如，如果拾取装置的速度太快，而收集箱又设计得不好，那么游戏碎片就可能飞出来。如果拾取装置速度太慢，在接触得分道具时可能会卡住。"

"It is possible for pieces to get jammed at an unreachable angle, especially "
"when using wheeled intakes. If this occurs, ensure that the driver can jar "
"the stuck element loose to avoid having a disabled robot."
msgstr "元件有可能卡在无法触及的角度，特别是在使用轮式拾取装置时。如果出现这种情况，应确保操作手能将卡住的元件撬开，以免机器人瘫痪。"

"Optimally, the game elements should follow a certain path each time if "

"It is best practice that the driver can see the game elements which are "

"The answer is usually one or two straight lines. The closer the scoring "
"elements follow this path, the faster they will go from collection to "

msgstr "答案通常是一条或两条直线。得分道具越靠近这条路径，它们从收集到存入的速度就越快。除非需要，否则不要设置过长的路线。"
