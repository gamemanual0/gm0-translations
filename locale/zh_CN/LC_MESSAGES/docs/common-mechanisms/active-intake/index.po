"There are multiple parts of an effective intake: intake geometry, intake "
"type and material, and speed. However, a common rule of them is the faster "
"the intake, often the more effective it is. For example, near the end of "
"Rover Ruckus, many of the top performing teams used a 3.7:1 (1600 RPM) motor"
" or a 5.2:1 (1000 RPM) motor on their intake."

"有用的吸入装置有多个部分：吸入口的几何形状、吸入物体类型和材料以及速度。然而，它们的一个共同规则是吸入速度越大，通常来说，越有效。例如，在Rover "
"Ruckus比赛接近尾声时，许多具有顶级表现的团队在进气时使用了3.7:1（1600转）电机或5.2:1（1000转）的电机。"

"While not a necessity, it is highly recommended that teams dedicate at least"
" one motor to their intake if possible."
msgstr "虽然并非完全必要，但强烈建议团队有可能的话至少使用一个电机来做吸入装置。"

"When this robot drives up to a ball, it barely has to point itself at the "
"ball before the ball is instantly locked in between the two rows of wheels. "
"What makes it so effective is the immense amount of testing that went into "
"its design. The team tried a number of intake shapes, initially building "
"with wood and rubber bands, and recorded which shapes were most effective. "
"By testing their intake design out before competition, they didn't have to "
"guess whether it would work as intended: they put it on the field with "
"confidence."

"当这个机器人驶向一个球时，它几乎不需要把自己对准球，球就会立即被锁在两排轮子之间。它如此有效的原因是它的设计中进行了大量的测试。该团队尝试了许多吸入装置的形状，最初是用木头和橡皮筋建造的，并记录了哪些形状最有效。通过在比赛前测试他们的吸入装置的设计，他们不必猜测它是否会按预期工作：他们自信地把它放在比赛场地上。"
