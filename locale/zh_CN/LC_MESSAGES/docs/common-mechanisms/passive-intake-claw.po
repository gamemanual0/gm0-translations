"Passive intakes are mechanisms in which the driver must pick up individual "
"items, usually by actuating some sort of gripper, which holds the game "
"element."

"Claws are the most common sort of passive intake and probably one of the "
"first mechanisms that jump to mind during brainstorming. Unlike most "
"intakes, claws can be made with only servos, and thus don't require valuable"
" motor slots."
msgstr ""
"爪子是最常见的被动吸入拾取装置，可能是头脑风暴中首先想到的机构之一。与大多数吸入拾取装置不同，爪子只需舵机即可制作，因此不需要有价值的电机插槽。"

"This is not to say there are no disadvantages; notably, unlike intakes, when"
" you pick up something with a claw, it isn't easy to transfer the collected "
"element to a separate scoring mechanism. For this reason, in most cases, "
"claws double as both a collection method and a scoring method."
msgstr ""
"这并不是说没有缺点；值得注意的是，与吸入拾取装置不同，当你用爪子拾取东西时，将收集的元素转移到单独的评分机制并不容易。因此，在大多数情况下，爪子既是一种收集方法，也是一种评分方法。"

"**Claws are extremely useful for picking up large, unwieldy elements that "
"cannot be controlled by active intakes**. For example, the relic in Relic "
"Recovery would be much harder to control using a more active intake; so "
"teams used a claw."
msgstr ""
"**爪子对于拾取无法被主动摄取控制的大而笨重的元素非常有用。例如，Relic Recovery中的 relic "
"使用更主动的吸入拾取装置会更难控制；所以团队使用爪子。**"
