"Many teams in the community have converged on a unique solution that isn't "
"seen very much outside of FTC: the use of \"dead wheels,\" \"tracking "
"wheels,\" or \"odometry pods\" (these terms are all synonymous). These refer"
" to small \"dead\" or non-driven (not powered by a motor) wheels attached to"
" an `encoder sensor <#encoders>`_. Two or three dead wheel pods are often "
"sprung to the ground to ensure accurate tracking. The two-wheel design "
"utilizes one parallel and one perpendicular pod (parallel and perpendicular "
"with respect to the drive wheel axis), measuring x and y movement "
"respectively. Change in heading is measured via a gyroscope. The three-wheel"
" design utilizes two parallel and one perpendicular pod, measuring x and y "
"movement respectively. However, this design forgoes the gyroscope and "
"instead measures heading via the difference with the two parallel wheels. "
"This is often more accurate in the context of the FTC control system because"
" the BNO055 IMU (used for the gyroscope in the two-wheel design) utilizes "
"I2C which is slower than the rest of the I/O on the REV Hub and cannot be "
"bulk read. These two issues lead to minute drift issues which can compound "
"over time, thus leading to a more inaccurate localization system when using "
"the two-wheel design."

"社区中的许多团队已经聚集在一个独特的解决方案上，这个解决方案在FTC之外并不常见：使用“无动力全向轮”、“跟踪轮”或“内置里程传感器的全向轮”（这些术语都是同义词）。这些是指连接到编码器传感器上的小型“无动力全向轮”或非驱动（不是由电机驱动）车轮。两个或三个无动力全向轮的里程计通常会通过内置弹簧弹跳反应地面位置以确保准确的跟踪。两轮设计使用一个平行和一个垂直里程计（相对于驱动轮轴平行和垂直），分别测量x和y运动。航向的变化通过陀螺仪测量。三轮设计使用两个平行和一个垂直里程传感器，分别测量x和y运动。然而，这种设计放弃了陀螺仪，而是通过与两个平行车轮的差异来测量航向。这在FTC控制系统中通常更准确，因为BNO055IMU（用于两轮设计中的陀螺仪）使用I2C，其速度比REV集线器上的其余I/O慢，并且无法批量读取。这两个问题会导致微小的偏移问题，这些问题会随着时间的推移而加剧，从而在使用两轮设计时导致更不准确的定位系统。"
