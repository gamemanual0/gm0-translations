"This is a very niche aspect of design in FTC\\ |reg|. Generally it is "

"这是 FTC\\ |reg| 设计中一个非常小众的方面。一般来说，经验丰富的团队才会这样做，因为他们有时间在休赛期反复用软件测试自己的设计和机制。"

"The term dead wheels, tracking wheels, odometry pods, and odometry are often"
" conflated in the FTC community. However, there are a few key differences "
"one must keep in mind. Odometry is an umbrella term and refers to the "
"general use of motion sensors for localization purposes. Meanwhile, dead "
"wheels, tracking wheels, and odometry pods are all synonymous terms."
msgstr ""
"术语“惰轮”、“履带从动轮”、“编码器吊舱”和“编码器”在FTC社区中经常混淆使用。然而，必须记住几个关键区别。编码器是一个总称，指的是使用运动传感器进行定位目的的一般性使用。与此同时，“惰轮”、“履带从动轮”和“编码器吊舱”都是同义词。"
