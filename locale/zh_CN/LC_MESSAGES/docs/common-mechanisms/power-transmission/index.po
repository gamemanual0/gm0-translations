"When building any mechanism, it is important to consider how the mechanism "
"will be powered, as gear ratio and form factor are two factors that affect "
"both spacing and efficiency. There are four main forms of power "
"transmission: direct drive, gears, chain, and timing belt. In addition, "
"there are different ways of powering a mechanism that is mounted on an axle."

"在制造任何机械装置时，都必须考虑该装置的传动方式，因为齿轮比和外形尺寸是影响间距和效率的两个因素。动力传输主要有四种形式：直接驱动、齿轮、链条和同步带。此外，为安装在车轴上的机械装置提供动力的方式也各不相同。"
