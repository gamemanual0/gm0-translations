"If you are powering any mechanism with a :term:`live axle <Live Axle>` "
"system, you will need a way to retain the shaft so that it does not move "
"axially (along its length). It is necessary to constrain movement in both "
"directions, and two methods can be mixed and matched on one shaft. "
"Generally, this is done by having something contact the bearing's inner race"
" that is constrained axially on the shaft. It is important to make sure the "
"bearings themselves are also constrained."

"如果使用 :term:`live axle<Live Axle>` "
"系统为任何机构提供动力，则需要一种方法来固定轴，使其不会沿轴向（其长度方向）移动。有必要对两个方向的运动进行限制，可以在一根轴上混合使用两种方法。一般来说，要做到这一点，需要有东西接触轴上轴向受限的轴承内圈。重要的是要确保轴承本身也受到约束。"

"Set screw collars use a set screw (typically a grub screw) to tighten down "
"onto the shaft. While set screw collars are cheap and readily available, "
"there are some disadvantages. The screw digs into the shaft, creating a "
"raised burr, making it difficult to remove/adjust the collar or to use the "
"shaft for something else in the future."

"固定螺丝轴环使用一个固定螺丝（通常是一个防松螺丝）来拧紧轴。虽然固定螺丝轴环既便宜又容易获得，但也有一些缺点。螺丝会钻入轴中，形成一个凸起的毛刺，导致难以移除/调整轴环或将来将轴用于其他用途。"

"A clamping shaft collar uses typical bolts to clamp the shaft, applying "
"force all around the shaft instead of just in one place. They may or may not"
" have a built-in shim to rest against a bearing race. They are generally "
"recommended over set screw collars, especially for high-load applications. "
"However, they do tend to be more expensive and larger."
msgstr ""
"夹紧轴环使用典型的螺栓夹紧轴，在轴的四周而不仅仅是一个地方施加力。这种轴环可能有内置垫片，也可能没有内置垫片，用于靠在轴承滚道上。一般推荐使用这种轴环，而不是固定螺钉轴环，尤其是在高负荷应用中。不过，它们往往更贵、更大。"
