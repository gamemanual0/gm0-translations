"Gears, like sprockets and pulleys, are used in power transmission for three "
"common applications: changing the direction of power, changing the amount of"
" torque, and changing RPM. Gears are a less common transmission option than "
"chain, but are still very viable for most use cases. Gears are equally as "
"reliable as chain, but can't be used for transferring power over long "
"distances. Many teams dislike gears when using kit-based channels because "
"the hole pattern limits which combinations of gears can be used. "
"Consequently, it may be difficult to achieve a desired specific gear ratio. "
"However, with :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` systems, it's very easy to use "
"different ratios, since the gears can be moved around in extrusion."
