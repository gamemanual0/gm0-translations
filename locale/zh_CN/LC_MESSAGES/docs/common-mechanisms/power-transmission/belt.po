"When using timing belts, correct tension is very important. There are two "
"main ways to get your tension right. The first is easy - goBILDA and "
"Actobotics already have belts integrated into their hole patterns. You can "
"buy correctly sized belt directly from each vendor, and your tension will be"
" perfect as soon as the belt is installed. As your designs gain complexity, "
"so will your belt runs - maybe there are more than 2 pulleys, and maybe your"
" pulleys are all different sizes. To compensate for this, the second way to "
"ensure tension is to use a dynamic tensioner, similar to those found in "
"complex chain runs. To design for these tensioners, we recommend planning "
"more complex belt runs in CAD before building them in real life."

"**Belt should, at the very least, have 90° of contact with the pulley. The "
"best practice is to have 180° or more of contact**, as it is very unlikely "
"to fall off with proper tensioning. Belt skipping, especially on drivetrains"
" or arms, is very possible without proper belt wrap or tensioning. When "
"tensioning belt, be sure to not undertension or overtension it. "
"Undertensioning belt can result in the belt falling off the pulley or belt "
"skipping, where the belt can skip along the pulley. Overtensioning belt "
"often results in the motor burning out, or less seriously, a loss of "
"efficiency. Push along the belt, and if it moves slightly without "
"significant resistance, chances are you've done it correctly. If it's too "
"tight, then the belt will barely move under a gentle press."
msgstr ""
"**同步带至少应与同步带轮呈 90° 接触。最好的做法是 180° "
"或更多的接触**，因为在正确张紧的情况下，同步带脱落的可能性很小。如果没有正确的缠绕或张紧，同步带很可能跳脱，特别是在传动系统或机械臂上。张紧同步带时，确保不要张紧不足或张紧过度。同步带张力不足会导致同步带从同步带轮上脱落或同步带跳动，即同步带沿着同步带轮跳动。同步带张力过大通常会导致电机烧毁，严重的还会降低效率。沿着同步带推动，如果皮带在没有明显阻力的情况下轻微移动，则很可能是正确的。如果太紧的话，轻轻按压同步带几乎不会移动。"
