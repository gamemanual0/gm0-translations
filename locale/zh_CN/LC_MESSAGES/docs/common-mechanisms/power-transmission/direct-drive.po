"Powering a mechanical part (most commonly a drive wheel) directly from the "
"motor axis. Many new and inexperienced teams will use this method to power "
"their drivetrain as it is the simplest way to do so. However, there are "
"significant drawbacks to this method."
msgstr ""
"直接从电机轴为机械部件（最常见的是驱动轮）提供动力。许多没有经验的新团队会使用这种方法为传动系统提供动力，因为这是最简单的方法。然而，这种方法也有很大的缺点。"

"Direct drive puts unnecessary load on the drive motor. This is because shock"
" loads can destroy gearboxes, even :term:`planetary gearboxes <Planetary "
"Gear>`. Gearboxes are able to withstand load along the axis of rotation, "
"such as what occurs when the wheel changes direction. This is a normal "
"situation of load. However, in direct drive, the gearbox shaft can be "
"exposed to other shock loads outside of the normal axis. This happens when "
"the wheel comes into contact with another robot or the field wall, which "
"honestly happens more than you'd think. This can bend the motor shaft or "
"permanently damage the gearbox."
msgstr ""
"直接驱动会给驱动电机带来不必要的负载。这是因为冲击负荷会破坏齿轮箱，即使是 :term:`planetary gearboxes <Planetary "
"Gear>`。齿轮箱能够承受沿旋转轴方向的负载，例如车轮改变方向时的负载。这是正常的负载情况。但是，在直接驱动中，齿轮箱轴可能会受到正常轴以外的其他冲击载荷。当车轮接触到另一个机器人或场地墙壁时，就会发生这种情况。这会导致电机轴弯曲或永久性损坏齿轮箱。"

"It also limits the :term:`gear ratio <Gear Reduction>` to whatever ratio the"
" motor gearbox is at. One advantage of all the other three transmission "
"systems is the ability to gear up or down, based on a team's needs. Direct "
"drive cannot do so, and if your drivetrain uses 40:1 gearboxes, there is no "
"way to reduce this ratio to a faster 20:1 gearbox, for example."
msgstr ""
"它还将 :term:`gear ratio <Gear Reduction>` "
"限制为电机变速箱的任何传动比。其他三种传动系统的一个优点是可以根据车队的需要增减齿轮。而直接驱动则无法做到这一点，例如，如果您的传动系统使用40:1的变速箱，则无法将此比率降低到更快的20:1变速箱。"

"Motor shafts are not built to carry large amounts of downward load. This can"
" lead to bending of the motor shaft, since in direct drive the shaft is only"
" supported by one side, the gearbox. Generally, a principle among all "
"engineers is to support the shaft on both sides, which isn't possible in "
"this case. This leads to :term:`cantilevering <Cantilever>` the shaft, "
"something that should be avoided in general. Thus, with a heavy robot the "
"motor shafts can easily be bent due to a lack of support. (While typically "
"it is impossible to support a motor shaft on both ends, it is a common rule "
"of thumb to have dual support on wheels or other non-motor shafts.)"

"电机轴的构造不能承受较大的向下负荷。这可能会导致电机轴弯曲，因为在直接驱动中，轴仅由一侧（即变速箱）支撑。一般来说，所有工程师的原则都是在两侧支撑轴，但在这种情况下是不可能的。这将导致:"
" term:`悬臂 <Cantilever>` "
"轴的倾斜，而这在一般情况下是应该避免的。因此，对于重型机器人来说，由于缺乏支撑，电机轴很容易弯曲。(虽然电机轴的两端通常不可能都有支撑，但通常的经验法则是在轮子或其他非电机轴上设置双重支撑）。"

"A cantilever refers to when an object (usually a :term:`shaft <Shaft>`) is "
"only supported on one side. While this provides theoretically less support, "
"as long as the shaft is still supported at two points by :term:`bearings "
"<Ball Bearing>` or :term:`bushings <Bushing>`, cantilever is still a sound "
"building technique. Many drivetrains are cantilevered, which provides for "
"easy access to wheels."

"悬臂是指一个物体（通常是一根 :term:`轴 <Shaft>`）只有一侧有支撑。虽然从理论上讲，悬臂提供的支撑较少，但只要轴的两点仍由 "
":term:`球承轴 <Ball Bearing>` 或 :term:`轴套 <Bushing>` "
"支撑，悬臂仍不失为一种合理的建筑技术。许多传动系统都是悬臂式的，这样可以方便地接触车轮。"
