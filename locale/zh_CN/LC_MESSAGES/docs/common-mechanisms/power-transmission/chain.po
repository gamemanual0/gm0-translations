"When your shafts aren't right next to each other, roller chain and sprockets"
" will allow you to transmit power securely between your shafts."
msgstr "当你的轴不相邻时，滚子链和链轮将允许你在轴之间安全地传输动力。"

"**Chain should, at the very least, have 90 degrees of contact with the "
"sprocket. The best practice is to have 180 degrees or more of contact**, as "
"it is very unlikely to fall off with proper tensioning. Chain skipping, "
"especially on drivetrains or arms, is very possible without proper chain "
"wrap or tensioning."
msgstr ""
"**链条至少应与链轮接触 90 度。最好的做法是链条与链轮接触 180 "
"度或更多**，因为如果张紧得当，链条脱落的可能性很小。如果没有适当的链条缠绕或张紧，链条很可能跳动，尤其是在传动系统或机械臂上。"

"**Chain can be pretty precise**. When properly tensioned, roller chain "
"doesn't have very much slop. However, you really need to get your chain "
"tension right to reduce slop, and you'll probably want an adjustable "
"tensioner for when the chain stretches. This can be done easily if using "
"extrusion systems, as the sprocket can be adjusted for tension."
msgstr ""
"**链条可以非常精确* "
"*。如果张紧得当，滚子链不会有太大的松弛。不过，你需要适当地张紧链条以减少滑动，而且你可能需要一个可调节的张紧器，以便在链条拉伸时使用。如果使用挤压系统，这一点很容易做到，因为链轮可以根据张力进行调整。"

"**Chain stretches over time**. As it's used, the connections between the "
"links and rollers can stretch a bit. While it doesn't look like much, this "
"stretching can introduce lots of slop into your chain run and even derail it"
" in some cases. You'll most likely need an adjustable tensioner to keep your"
" tension over time - some teams have used spring-loaded dynamic tensioners "
"to automatically compensate for any changes."
msgstr ""
"** 链条会随着时间的推移而拉伸** "
"。链条在使用过程中，链节和滚子之间的连接会有一些拉伸。虽然看起来不大，但这种拉伸会给链条运行带来很大的不稳定性，在某些情况下甚至会使链条脱轨。您很可能需要一个可调节的张紧器来长期保持张力"
"--有些车队使用弹簧式动态张紧器来自动补偿任何变化。"

"**The smaller the sprocket, the faster the chain stretch**. This is because "
"when the chain is run on a smaller sprocket, more force is applied due to a "
"smaller radius."
msgstr "链轮越小，链条拉伸越快。这是因为当链条在较小的链轮上运行时，由于半径较小，会产生更大的力。"
