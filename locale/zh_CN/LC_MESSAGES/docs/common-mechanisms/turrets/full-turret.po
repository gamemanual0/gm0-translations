"Bearing stacks are stacks of bearings, usually consisting of a small bearing"
" sandwiched between two large bearings on a screw shaft or standoff. A "
"bearing stack turret has a disc that rotates smoothly because it is tangent "

"constrain the disc vertically. Usually, the small bearing is a radial "
"bearing, while the big bearings may be thrust or radial bearings, depending "
"on which loads the turret experiences."

"轴承组是轴承的组合，通常由夹在螺旋轴或支座上两个大轴承之间的一个小轴承组成。轴承堆转塔有一个圆盘，由于与许多轴承堆上的小轴承相切，圆盘可以平稳旋转，而大轴承则垂直限制圆盘。通常，小轴承是径向轴承，而大轴承可能是推力轴承或径向轴承，具体取决于转盘承受的载荷。"
