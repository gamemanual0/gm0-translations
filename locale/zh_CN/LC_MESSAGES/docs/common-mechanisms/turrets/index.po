"In FTC\\ |reg|, turrets refer to mechanisms that allow for yaw (side-to-"
"side) rotation of another mechanism. This is typically done for the purpose "
"of positioning an intake or scoring mechanism. For example, a shooter could "
"be mounted on a turret to allow for aiming without turning the robot. "
"Turrets typically have a gear, sprocket, or pulley mounted to them, which "
"motors and servos use to rotate them."

"在 FTC\\ |reg| "
"中，发射结构指的是允许一个装置在水平旋转，类似炮塔。这样做的目的通常是为了定位抓取或得分装置。例如，射击装置可以安装在转塔上，以便在不转动机器人的情况下进行瞄准。发射结构上通常安装有齿轮、链轮或滑轮，电机和舵机利用这些齿轮、链轮或滑轮进行旋转。"

"The FTC community often splits these turrets into 2 categories, \"full "
"turrets\" and \"mini turrets.\" Full turrets are typically those powered by "
"motors or multiple servos at the base of the robot, and move large "
"mechanism(s), and what the lone word \"turret\" generally refers to. Mini "
"turrets are typically powered by one or two servos, are located at the end "
"of an extension of some sort, and only pivot an end effector."

"FTC 社区通常将这些发射结构分为 2 类：\"全方位发射结构\" 和 "
"\"小关节装置\"。全方位发射结构通常由机器人底部的电机或多个舵机驱动，可移动大型机械装置，\"发射结构\" "
"一词通常指的就是全方位发射结构。小关节装置通常由一个或两个舵机提供动力，位于某种延伸装置的末端，只能转动一个末端效应器。"
