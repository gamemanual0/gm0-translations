"Lead screws use a threaded rod to create high-torque linear motion. Their "
"primary advantage is being able to handle much higher loads than other "
"unmodified kit options. While this option was popularized in Rover Ruckus "
"for hanging robots, variations have been in use since as far back as Res-Q. "
"Another use case for lead screws is to change the angle of an arm platform, "
"though this is more common in FRC\\ |reg|. However, this ability to handle "
"high loads comes at a cost: lead screws are extremely slow."

"导螺杆使用螺纹杆来产生高扭矩线性运动。其主要优点是能够承受比其他未改装套件高得多的负载。虽然这种选择在用于悬挂机器人的 Rover Ruckus "
"中得到了推广，但早在 Res-Q 中就已经开始使用各种变体。导螺杆的另一个用例是改变机械臂平台的角度，不过这在 FRC\\ |reg| "
"中更为常见。然而，这种处理高负载的能力是有代价的：导螺杆的速度极慢。"

"By far the most popular lead screw option is the `ServoCity Linear Actuator "
"kit <https://www.servocity.com/linear-actuator-kit-a-7-4-stroke-x-rail-"
"piston/>`_. Overall, this kit is lightweight, simple, and cheap. It can be a"
" good start for teams using REV and needing a linear extension, and is "
"generally usable out of the box."

"并需要线性扩展的团队来说，它是一个良好的开端，一般开箱即可使用。"
