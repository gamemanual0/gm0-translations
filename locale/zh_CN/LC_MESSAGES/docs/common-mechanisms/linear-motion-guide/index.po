"Linear motion is one of the most important components of a successful robot."
" In most games, teams are required to reach into an area that the drivetrain"
" cannot access in order to pick up or deposit game elements. For example, in"
" 2017-2018, Relic Recovery, teams needed to extend an arm of some sort to "
"grab the Relic that was placed in the corner of the playing field. This area"
" of the game field was nearly impossible for a robot to drive to, so a "
"linear extension was necessary."

"线性运动是一台出色的机器人最重要的组成部分之一。在大多数游戏中，参赛队需要伸手到传动系统无法触及的区域，以拾取或存放游戏元素。例如，在 "
"2017-2018 年的 \"Relic Recovery\" "
"中，参赛队需要伸出某种手臂才能抓住放置在比赛场地角落的遗迹。机器人几乎无法驶入游戏场地的这一区域，因此必须进行线性延伸。"

"Access of > 18\" is necessary for nearly all games; >24\" is preferred. In "
"some games, an extension of 36\" or more may be needed."
msgstr "几乎所有游戏都需要大于 18 英寸的伸长量；最好大于 24 英寸。在某些比赛中，可能需要 36 英寸或更长的伸长量。"

"It is possible to achieve extension with an arm, but since this guide is "
"geared toward newer teams, linear extensions should be prioritized over "
"arms. Refer to the :doc:`Arm Guide </docs/common-mechanisms/arms>` for more "

"使用机械臂也可以实现伸展，但由于本指南面向的是较新的团队，因此线性伸展应优先于机械臂。更多信息请参阅 :doc:`Arm Guide "
