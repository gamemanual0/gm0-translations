"Linear bearings are specialty ball bearings. Unlike radial ball bearings, "
"they run balls through cyclical tracks along the length of a rail or shaft "
"to create smooth, stable, precise linear motion. They are used in many "
"industrial automation systems, including 3D printers and CNC machines."

"Unlike with most slides, the balls of linear bearings are not well retained "

"与大多数滑轨不同，当轴承从导轨上取下时，直线轴承的滚珠不能很好地保留。缺少一些滚珠的直线轴承性能会略有下降。请务必小心处理和储存轴承，并在滚珠脱落时做好准备。"
