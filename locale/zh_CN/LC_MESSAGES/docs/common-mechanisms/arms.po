"Arms are another way to achieve extension past the 18\" x 18\" dimension of "
"the robot. Unlike linear extensions, arms require lots of torque - a "
"standard 40:1 or even 60:1 gearbox will not be suitable in most "
"applications. For example, many teams will run a 256:1 gearbox for their "
"rotation motor."
msgstr ""
"手臂是机器人延伸超过18\"x "
"18\"尺寸的另一种方式。与线性延伸不同，手臂需要很大的扭矩——标准的40:1甚至60:1变速箱不适合大多数应用。例如，许多团队将为他们的旋转电机运行256:1变速箱。"

"Rarely should an arm be directly mounted to the driving motor. Instead, "
"torque should be transferred via gear, chain, or belt. Large arms can also "
"be hard to control (with the addition of momentum adding load to the "
"gearbox, it is hard to stop a three-foot arm that weighs five pounds quickly"
" without breaking a gearbox). In many cases, this issue can be mitigated "
"with software (see the :doc:`/docs/software/concepts/control-loops` "
"section)."
msgstr ""
"手臂很少应该直接安装在驱动电机上。相反，扭矩应该通过齿轮、链条或皮带传递。大型手臂也很难控制（随着动量的增加，变速箱的负载增加，很难在不破坏变速箱的情况下快速停止一个三英尺重的手臂）。在许多情况下，这个问题可以通过软件来缓解（参见控制回路部分）。"
