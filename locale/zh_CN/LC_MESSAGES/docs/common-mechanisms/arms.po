"Arms are another way to achieve extension past the 18\" x 18\" dimension of "
"the robot. Unlike linear extensions, arms require lots of torque - a "
"standard 40:1 or even 60:1 gearbox will not be suitable in most "
"applications. For example, many teams will run a 256:1 gearbox for their "
"rotation motor."
msgstr ""
"机械臂是机器人延伸超过18\"x "
"18\"尺寸的另一种方式。与线性延伸不同，机械臂需要很大的扭矩——标准的40:1甚至60:1变速箱不适合大多数应用。例如，许多团队将为他们的旋转电机运行256:1变速箱。"

"Rarely should an arm be directly mounted to the driving motor. Instead, "
"torque should be transferred via gear, chain, or belt. Large arms can also "
"be hard to control (with the addition of momentum adding load to the "
"gearbox, it is hard to stop a three-foot arm that weighs five pounds quickly"
" without breaking a gearbox). In many cases, this issue can be mitigated "
"with software (see the :doc:`/docs/software/concepts/control-loops` "
"section)."
msgstr ""
"机械臂很少应该直接安装在驱动电机上。相反，扭矩应该通过齿轮、链条或皮带传递。大型机械臂也很难控制（随着动量的增加，变速箱的负载增加，很难在不破坏变速箱的情况下快速停止一个三英尺重的机械臂）。在许多情况下，这个问题可以通过软件来缓解（参见控制回路部分）。"

"The most simple type of arm in FTC, a single arm refers to an arm on one "
"axis of rotation. While it is possible to successfully build this kind of "
"arm, generally a single axis arm will only afford around 15-16\" of "
"extension, which is inadequate for nearly every game."

"The reason for this is that the longest a channel can be is 18\" "
"(technically you could have a longer channel by placing it diagonally, but "
"this complicates matters). Thus, with a maximum of 18\" of extension, a "
"couple inches must be subtracted, since the point of rotation is inside the "
"18\" sizing cube; therefore the extension is around 15-16\"."
msgstr ""
"这样做的原因是C形梁最长可以是18英寸（从技术上讲，您可以通过对角线放置C形梁来获得更长的C形梁，但这会使问题复杂化）。因此，最大18英寸的延伸，必须减去几英寸，因为旋转点在18英寸的尺寸立方体内；因此延伸约为15-16英寸。"

"Therefore, a single arm with further linear extension is optimal. For "
"example, some teams built a single arm with an added linear extension "
"mechanism to reach the desired extension length, which is generally >24\"."
msgstr "因此，具有进一步线性延伸的单臂是最优的。例如，一些团队构建了具有附加线性延伸机制的单臂以达到所需的延伸长度，一般为>24\"。"
